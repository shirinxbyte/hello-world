# hello-world

I believe every journey begins with a single step. Last week, after being let go from my previous job, I decided to embark on the path of becoming an AI Developer.

For me, writing my first "Hello World" program is more than just a technical milestone—it's my way of introducing myself to this new chapter in the world of technology.

While I’ll definitely be coding my "Hello World" in this repository, I’ll also be documenting my learning journey in this README file. This will be a space to share my progress, challenges, and discoveries along the way.
